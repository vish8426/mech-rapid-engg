Manufacturing Engineering - Rapid Engineering Project

## About
Within the Rapid Engineeringâ€‹ laboratory session, the project that was undertaken involved the importation of a ready-made 3D CAD model into a printing/CAD software interface. Furthermore, the project encompassed the calibration of the model alongside 3D printing hardware. The model was finally 3D printed with plastic filament material and compared with the CAD model on the software.

## Overview

The project focuses on the practical application of rapid prototyping techniques in manufacturing engineering. By utilizing 3D printing technology, the project aims to bridge the gap between digital design and physical production, enabling quick iteration and testing of designs.

## Project Objectives

- Import a 3D CAD model into a printing/CAD software interface.
- Calibrate the model with 3D printing hardware.
- Produce a physical prototype using plastic filament material.
- Compare the printed model with the original CAD design to evaluate accuracy.

## Methodology

1. **Model Importation**: Import the ready-made 3D CAD model into compatible printing/CAD software.
2. **Calibration**: Adjust the model settings within the software to match the specifications of the 3D printing hardware.
3. **Printing**: Use 3D printing technology to produce the physical prototype from plastic filament material.
4. **Comparison**: Measure and analyze the printed model against the original CAD design to assess dimensional accuracy and quality.

## Applications

- **Rapid Prototyping**: Quickly produce physical models for design validation and testing.
- **Manufacturing Engineering**: Apply 3D printing techniques in the development of manufacturing processes.
- **Product Development**: Utilize rapid prototyping to accelerate the development cycle of new products.
