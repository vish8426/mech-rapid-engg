Manufacturing Engineering - Rapid Engineering Project

## About
Within the Rapid Engineeringâ€‹ laboratory session, the project that was undertaken involved the importation of a ready-made 3D CAD model into a printing/CAD software interface. Furthermore, the project encompassed the calibration of the model alongside 3D printing hardware. The model was finally 3D printed with plastic filament material and compared with the CAD model on the software.
